Welcome to Junmo1215's card.

The hardware of this board forked from [this project](https://lceda.cn/Giftina/ESP8266_CARD), it's a development board based on ESP8266, which has a WiFi module so it can be used as an AP(Access Point) or a station. It also has a 4M Flash so it can store the html file as you see now.

Software is developed with [NodeMcu](https://github.com/AndiDittrich/NodeMCU-Tool). This project allows you to easily develop with lua on ESP8266. Using ESP8266 as an AP and create a WiFi named junmo1215 when it is powered on, then listen on port 80 in order to receive requests for the http default port.
